# Toolchains

This repository stores all the toolchains that contain backend compilers, which allow **thrushc** to **effectively compile to a given architecture**. This repository is also used by the thrush package manager (**throium**) to download, install, and configure the compiler for proper operation on the hosted system.

This repository contains toolchains with:

- **LLVM tools** (v17.0.6)
- **Clang** (v17.0.6)

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is subject to any type of update, so the content of each tool chain does not represent the final version of each one of them. It is adapted to the needs of the language.
